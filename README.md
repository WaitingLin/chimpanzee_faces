PROVIDED DATA
=========

**Images**   

We provide two datasets of cropped chimpanzee faces: CZoo and CTai.  For details of both datasets, please refer to the corresponding paper (e.g., available at [this pdf link](http://hera.inf-cv.uni-jena.de:6680/pdf/Freytag16_CFW.pdf) ).  

**Labels**   
In addition to the pure images, the dataset comes with annotations of identity, gender, age, and age group. All annotations have been provided by experts.  More details about statistics of data are shown in the supplementary material (e.g., available at [this pdf link](http://hera.inf-cv.uni-jena.de:6680/supplementary/Freytag16_CFW.pdf) ).  

**Train/Test Splits**   
We provide five splits intro train and test which have been used to produce the results in Table 1 of the GCPR'16 paper. The demo script (see below) shows how to access data accordingly.


HOW TO ACCESS
=========
We provided a tiny matlab script which loads one of the datasets, requests the splits, and loops through the images. Depending on your needs, you might want to use this as a starting point for your own evaluations.
